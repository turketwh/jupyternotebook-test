# jupyternotebook-test
Repository to experiment with jupyter notebooks and binder

This repository is to explore how to use python, jupyter notebooks, binder, and mybinder.org to automatically create environments for jupyter notebooks.  I'm hoping this will be useful in teaching my fall 2018 classes.
